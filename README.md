# Check Point Research

This repository serves as a supplement to our [research blog](https://research.checkpoint.com/).

The different folders in the repository contain various scripts, .pcap recordings, and malware IOCs that we developed / recorded / gathered during our research, and that we chose to share with the info-sec research community.
