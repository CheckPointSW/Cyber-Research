## Check Point Research - Reverse Engineering

This sub-folder will host a collection of general purpose reverse engineering scripts that we develop to assist in our research efforts. Once a given script develops into a fully functional plugin (like [Karta](https://github.com/CheckPointSW/Karta)) it will be moved into it's own repository.

Serves as a supplement to our research blog posts which are published on our [blog](https://research.checkpoint.com/).
